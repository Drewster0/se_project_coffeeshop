This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Adding an option to order to-go online would be extremely convenient to customers short on time. Updating the recipes will give customers more options for their enjoyment. To help customers better understand what each coffee and baked good is, images can be inmbedded into links on each menu item with a description of that coffee or baked good.
